## Features

### Prompts

The following prompts are available

- `create-task` - Create a new task in Dart with title, description, status, priority, and assignee
- `create-doc` - Create a new document in Dart with title, text content, and folder
- `summarize-tasks` - Get a summary of tasks with optional filtering by status and assignee

These prompts make it easy for AI assistants to perform common actions in Dart without needing to understand the underlying API details.

### Resource templates

The following resources are available

- `dart-config:` - Configuration information about the user's space
- `dart-task:///{taskId}` - Detailed information about specific tasks
- `dart-doc:///{docId}` - Detailed information about specific docs

### Tools

The following tools are available

#### Task management

- `get_config` - Get information about the user's space, including available assignees, dartboards, folders, statuses, tags, priorities, and sizes
- `list_tasks` - List tasks with optional filtering by assignee, status, dartboard, priority, due date, and more
- `create_task` - Create a new task with title, description, status, priority, size, dates, dartboard, assignees, tags, and parent task
- `get_task` - Retrieve an existing task by its ID
- `update_task` - Update an existing task's properties
- `delete_task` - Move a task to the trash (recoverable)
- `add_task_comment` - Add a comment to an existing task

#### Document management

- `list_docs` - List docs with optional filtering by folder, title, text content, and more

Each tool supports comprehensive input validation and returns structured JSON responses.

## Setup

The easiest way to run the MCP server is with `npx`, but a Docker setup is also available.

### Find the MCP settings file for the client

#### Claude Desktop

2. Copy your authentication token from [your Dart profile](https://app.itsdart.com/?settings=account)
3. Run the following command, being sure to replace `dsa...` with your actual Dart token

   ```bash
   claude mcp add-json dart '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","dart-mcp-server"],"env":{"DART_TOKEN":"dsa_..."}}'
   ```

#### Cursor

1. [Install Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) as needed
2. Open the config file by opening Cursor, going into 'Cursor Settings' (not the normal VSCode IDE settings), opening the 'MCP' tab, and clicking the 'Add new global MCP server' button
3. Follow the 'Set up the MCP server' steps below

#### Cline

1. [Install Cline](https://cline.bot/) in your IDE as needed

3. Follow the 'Set up the MCP server' steps below

#### Windsurf

1. [Install Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/download) as needed

3. Follow the 'Set up the MCP server' steps below

#### Any other client

1. Find the MCP settings file, usually something like `[client]_mcp_config.json`
2. Follow the 'Set up the MCP server' steps below

### Set up the MCP server

1. [Install npx](https://nodejs.org/en/download), which comes bundled with Node, as needed
2. Copy your authentication token from [your Dart profile](https://app.itsdart.com/?settings=account)
3. Add the following to your MCP setup, being sure to replace `dsa...` with your actual Dart token

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "dart": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "dart-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
           "DART_TOKEN": "dsa_..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Variant: setup with Docker :)

If the `npx` setup above does not work well, we also provide a Docker setup. Follow the instructions above to find the MCP settings file

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) as needed
2. Build the Docker container with `docker build -t mcp/dart .`
3. Copy your authentication token from [your Dart profile](https://app.itsdart.com/?settings=account)
4. Add the following to your MCP setup, being sure to replace `dsa...` with your actual Dart token

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "dart": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "DART_TOKEN", "mcp/dart"],
         "env": {
           "DART_TOKEN": "dsa_..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
